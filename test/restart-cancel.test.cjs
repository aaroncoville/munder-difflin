/**
 * Cancelling the quit warning must un-stick restart-to-install.
 *
 * The bug: `quitAndInstall()` reports nothing. It ASKS the app to quit, and with
 * agents running the app refuses and puts up the quit warning. The IPC handler
 * returned `{ ok: true }` at that moment, so every surface that had disabled its
 * button was told the restart had succeeded — and then the user cancelled, the
 * app carried on living, and the button sat on "restarting…" forever with
 * nothing left to resolve it.
 *
 * The fix is a wiring one and lives across two files, which is exactly why it is
 * worth pinning: the handler waits for an outcome, and the cancel path is the
 * thing that supplies it. Delete either half and the bug returns silently, with
 * every unit test still green, because nothing pure is involved.
